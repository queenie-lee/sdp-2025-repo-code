# Worksheet Three

## Lambda expressions in Java

+ This set of exercises examines your existing knowledge to reinforce the concepts from your previous studies.
+ It is essential that you commit regularly any changes to your source code (to the respective `GitHub Classroom` repository).
+ Where the questions make incremental changes to the code you **do not** need to keep separate versions of your code, as your commits will deal with that situation. 
+ Text-based questions should be answered inline by modifying this document.

## Learning goals

When you have completed this worksheet you should have achieved the following learning goals:

+ To work with the `Arrays` class.
+ To understand the flexibility of the lambda forms available from Java 8 onwards.
+ To write simple lambda expressions using the Java 8+ syntax.
+ To use *method references*.
+ To gain experience using `Predicate`.

You should be able to finish most of the non-star exercises during the lab session given your prior knowledge of the topic.

- Remember that star exercises are more difficult. 
- Do not attempt star exercises unless the other exercises are clear to you.

## Preamble

The `Arrays` class provides a number of static utility methods for manipulating arrays. For example, to print out an array, we could utilise `Arrays.asList`. 

The point of this is that if you just print an array directly, you do not see anything useful (just the type and memory address), but if you print a `List`, it shows the individual elements separated by commas (it is simpler than creating a loop to traverse the array and print out the elements).

## The Exercises

All the exercises should be answered using Java lambda expressions unless specified otherwise.

1. Create an array containing some `String`s. Sort the array by
	+ length (i.e., shortest to longest)
	+ reverse length (i.e., longest to shortest)
	+ first character
	+ Strings that contain `"e"` first, everything else second.
	
  Remember that the `compare` method of `Comparator` should return a negative number  if the first entry is less than the second, a positive number if the first entry is greater than the second, and 0 if they are the same. See the `JavaDoc` API for details.
  
2. For the last sorting example (strings with `"e"` first), move the logic that computes the number to a separate `static` method. For example,
  
   ```java
   StringUtils.eChecker(s1, s2)
   ```
   will return
   + -1 if `s1` is less than `s2` (i.e., it contains `"e"` but `s2` doesnâ€™t),
   + 1 if `s1` is greater than `s2`, and
   + 0 otherwise.
   
   Now, rewrite the last lambda sorting example, but use a method reference in place of an explicit lambda.
   
3.  Create a class with a `static` method called `betterString` which should take two `String`s and a lambda as its arguments; the lambda states whether the first of the two strings is *better*. The method should return the *better* string; i.e., if the lambda returns `true` the method should return the first string, otherwise it should return the second string.
      
      For the lambda, define an interface called `TwoStringPredicate` with a method that takes two `String`s and returns `true` if the first is better than the second, `false` otherwise.
   
      Here are two examples (the first returns whichever of `test1` and `test2` is longer, and the second always returns `test1`):
      
  + `StringUtils.betterString(test1, test2, (s1, s2) -> s1.length() > s2.length())`
  + `StringUtils.betterString(test1, test2, (s1, s2) -> true)`
    
4. Use generics to replace `betterString` with `betterEntry` and to replace `TwoStringPredicate` with `TwoElementPredicate`. Make sure your previous examples still work when you only change `betterString` to `betterElement`.

5. (*) Create a `static` method called `allMatches`. It should take a `List` of `String`s and a `Predicate<String>`, and return a new `List` of all the values that passed the test. Test it with several examples. For example:
   ```java
   List<String> shortWords = StringUtils.allMatches(words, s -> s.length() < 4);
   List<String> wordsWithB = StringUtils.allMatches(words, s -> s.contains("b"));
   List<String> evenLengthWords = StringUtils.allMatches(words, s -> (s.length() % 2) == 0);
   ```

6. (**) Rewrite `allMatches` so it works on any `List` and associated `Predicate`, not just on `String`s. Verify that the examples from the previous question still work. In addition, the following code should also work:
    ```java
        List<SavingsAccount> savingsAccountsList = List.of(new SavingsAccount(22), new SavingsAccount(42));
        savingsAccountsList.get(0).deposit(50000);
        List<BankAccount> bankAccountsList = List.of(new BankAccount(33), new SavingsAccount(57));
        bankAccountsList.get(0).deposit(20000);

        Predicate<BankAccount> predicate = b -> b.getBalance() > 0;

        List<SavingsAccount> savingsAccountsMatchesList = StringUtils.allMatches(savingsAccountsList, predicate);
        System.out.println(savingsAccountsMatchesList);
        List<BankAccount> bankAccountsMatchesList = StringUtils.allMatches(bankAccountsList, predicate);
        System.out.println(bankAccountsMatchesList);
    ```

7. (*) Create a `static` method called `transformedList`. It should take a `List` of `String`s and a `Function<String,String>` and return a new `List` that contains the results of applying the function to each element of the original list. For example:
   ```java
   List<String> excitingWords = StringUtils.transformedList(words, s -> s + "!");
   List<String> eyeWords = StringUtils.transformedList(words, s -> s.replace("i", "eye"));
   List<String> upperCaseWords = StringUtils.transformedList(words, String::toUpperCase);
   ```

8. (**) Rewrite `transformedList` so it works with generic types. Verify that the examples from the previous question still work. In addition, the following code should also work:
    ```java
        List<SavingsAccount> savingsAccountsList = List.of(new SavingsAccount(22), new SavingsAccount(42));
        List<BankAccount> bankAccountsList = List.of(new BankAccount(33), new SavingsAccount(57));

        Function<BankAccount, String> mapper =
                b -> String.format("%010d", b.getAccountNumber());

        List<String> savingsAccountsNumbersList = StringUtils.transformedList(savingsAccountsList, mapper);
        System.out.println(savingsAccountsNumbersList);
        List<String> bankAccountsNumbersList = StringUtils.transformedList(bankAccountsList, mapper);
        System.out.println(bankAccountsNumbersList);
    ```
